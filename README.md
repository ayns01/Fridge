## About
Fridge is a¬†food expiration date tracker.
It tells you when your food¬†is going to expire.

## Timeline
May.27.2019 ~ Jun.13.2019

## How to use
I made this app for my school project within 3 weeks.
I often forget a food expiration date that I bought.
In order to remind me of the used-by date, I made Fridge app.

### Registering a food information
To save your food information, you can select food group. Then go to food lists of the food group.
After that, set the expiration date and quantity.

### Database
To store data, It is used Cloud Firestore.
As Field, I prepared 4 field: "category", "foodName", "quantity", "usebyDate".<br>
This is my code to save data to Firestore.
```
private func sendDataToFireStore(categoryName: String, foodName: String, quantity: Int, usebyDate: Date) {

  var ref: DocumentReference? = nil
    let db = Firestore.firestore()
    ref = db.collection("usebyInfo").addDocument(data: [
        "category": categoryName,
        "foodName": foodName,
        "usebyDate": usebyDate,
        "quantity": quantity
    ]) { err in
        if let err = err {
            print("Error adding document: \(err)")
        } else {
            print("Document added with ID: \(ref!.documentID)")
        }
    }
}
```
